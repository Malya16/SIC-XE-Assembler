# SIC-XE-Assembler
This project implements a two-pass assembler for the SIC/XE architecture, converting assembly code into machine-readable object code. Pass 1 builds the Symbol Table, calculates addresses, and detects errors. Pass 2 generates object code using the OPTAB and SYMTAB, resolving addresses and formatting instructions for execution.
